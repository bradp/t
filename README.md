# `t`


Add this ish to your `$PATH` somewhere and just run it.

```
t - lists open todos

t add "Adding a new todo"
t a "Shortcut for adding a new todo"

t complete <todo number>
t x <todo number>
```




`t` saves everything in `~/.todo` if you want to manually edit it. It looks like this: 
  ```
  Buy Gob the Aztec Tomb
  Polish the Sword of Destiny
  ----------
  Hide money in the banana stand
  ```
